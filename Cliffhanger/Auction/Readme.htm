		<P>1. Overview</P>
		<P>The auction system is intended to give players a way of safely trading items of 
			high value. It provides an interface for creating auctions and&nbsp;bidding on 
			items. The system automatically moves the item auctioned and the money 
			exchanged through a convenient system of checks that makes sure that both the 
			seller and the buyer are protected against any risks. The system comes with a 
			convenient search engine for auctioned items based on text&nbsp;and type 
			searches, as well as sorting based on a number of conditions.</P>
		<P>This system is requires an installation of AoS on the server machine to access 
			localization tables, but is compatible with both AoS and not-AoS shards.</P>
		<P>2. Installation</P>
		<P>Installation is pretty straightforward: unzip the contents of the package into 
			your custom scripts folder. The system doesn't require any core scripts 
			modifications.</P>
		<P>Once the system is installed and the server is running, use the [InitAuction 
			command to create the auction control stone. This is a special item that can 
			only be constructed using the command. This item is invisible, so it can be 
			placed pretty much anywhere. Also it cannot be deleted by using the [Remove 
			command (in such a case it will simply re-create itself). The stone holds all 
			the information about the system, including all auctions, bids and items. It 
			can only be deleted using the [DeleteAuction command which will terminate 
			unsuccesfully all auctions.</P>
		<P>In order for players to access the system, spawn Auctioner mobiles in your 
			world. They can access the system by using the 'Buy' context menu on the 
			Auctioner or by saying the 'auction' keyword.</P>
		<P>Important : This script requires access to a fully patched cliloc.enu file. To 
			ensure this, install AoS on the server machine and patch it up. There is still 
			a chance the script will not find the file because of wrong registry 
			information. If you have trouble with the system (namely if nothing happens 
			when you target an item that you wish to auction), specify the path to the 
			cliloc.enu file manually.
		</P>
		<P>3. Configuration</P>
		<P>A number of parameters are available for configuration in AuctionSystem.cs, in 
			the Configuration region:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			MessageHue : defines the hue number used by all the messages in the system
			<LI>
			m_ForbiddenTypes: defines&nbsp;a list of item types that cannot be sold through 
			the auction system
			<LI>
			DaysForConfirmation: in some cases after the auction has ended, either the 
			buyer or seller must confirm their will to proceed with the auction. They will 
			be notified through the messaging system and required to take a decision. If no 
			decision is taken within a number of days, the auction ends unsuccesfully (item 
			returned to seller, highest bid returned to bidder). This parameter specifies 
			the number of days the system will wait before finalizing the auction.
			<LI>
			MaxReserveMultiplier: this is a limiting factor on the value of the reserve 
			which cannot be higher than the starting bid multiplied by this parameter. This 
			should avoid player exploiting the reserve feature by adding very high reserves 
			to all auctions and always have the chance to decide whether to sell in the end 
			or not.
			<LI>
			BlackHue : gumps have a weird behaviour when it comes to hues. Simply put they 
			are not capable to display hue #1 aka pure black, therefore for items hued 1 a 
			replacemente hue must be used. By default this is a black hue (#2000) in the 
			OSI hues file. You might need to verify this value if your shard uses a custom 
			hues.mul.
			<LI>
			AllowPetsAuction : true by default, enables auctioning of pets besides items.
			<LI>
			AuctionAdminAccessLevel : the minimum AccessLevel required to access 
			administration functions (Using the [AuctionAdmin command and the staff panel 
			for each auction).
			<LI>
			ClilocLocation : specify the full path for the cliloc.enu file if having 
			trouble with it.
			<LI>
			EnableLogging : true by default, will record all auction activity in 
			\RunUO\Logs\Auction.
			<LI>
			LateBidExtension: when a bid is placed within 5 minutes from the auction end, 
			and a positive time span is assigned to this option, the duration of the 
			auction will be extended by the amount specified. By default this is zero ( 
			TimeSpan.FromMinutes( 0.0 ) ).
			<LI>
				CostOfAuction: specifies how much the auction of an item costs (see the code 
				for details on how to configure this parameter).</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>Additional configuration is done using the Props of the control stone:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			MaxAuctionaParAccount: specifies the maximum number of simultaneous auctions a 
			single account can own.
			<LI>
			MinAuctionDays: specifies the minimum number of days an auction must last.
			<LI>
				MaxAuctionDays: specifies the maximum number of days an auction can last.</LI></UL>
		<P>4. Ths auction system includes a number of commands:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			[Admin] InitAuction : this command is used to create the auction control stone 
			(see: Installation). If a control stone already exists in the world, this 
			command will teleport the user to the stone location.
			<LI>
			[Admin] AuctionAdmin : this displays a panel giving control over the whole 
			system (delete, perform auction verification, profiling...)
			<LI>
			[GameMaster] Auction: brings up the main auction gump. Players have to access 
			this through the Auctioner NPC.
			<LI>
				[Player] MyAuction: brings up a limited auction gump. Players can only access 
				auctions they're already participating in. They can't use this gump to create 
				new auctions or to place bids on items they haven't bid on before.</LI></UL>
		<P>5. Creating an auction</P>
		<P>In order to create an auction, a player must visit an Auctioner NPC. After 
			selecting the object they wish to auction, the item will be removed from their 
			backpack. The user will then have to specify the parameters of the auction:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Starting bid: the minimum bid accepted for this auction
			<LI>
			Duration: the running time for the auction in days
			<LI>
			Reserve: a safety value considered when the auction ends. If the highest bid is 
			higher than the reserve the item is automatically sold, otherwise the owner 
			will be given the option to withdraw the auction and have the item returned. 
			The reserve value is not known to the bidder, but only information whether it 
			has been met or not.
			<LI>
			Name: the system will try to guess an appropriate name for the auction. The 
			user can of course change it to whatever they wish to.
			<LI>
			Description: any additional information should be given here. The system will 
			extract the properties of each item and automatically display them, so there is 
			no need to write them in this field.
			<LI>
				Web link: a web link can be provided optionally</LI></UL>
		<P>Once the auction is confirmed, it's put into the system and available for 
			everyone to bid on. Also once created, the auction can no longer be canceled by 
			the owner.</P>
		<P>6. Bidding on an auction</P>
		<P>If&nbsp;a player&nbsp;can bid on an auction,&nbsp;they will see the option in 
			the lower left area of the auction gump. They must have the required money for 
			the bid in&nbsp;their bank, which will be withdrawn as soon as&nbsp;the bid is 
			placed.</P>
		<P>When a higher bid is placed, the previous highest bidder will receive the money 
			back in the form of a auction gold check (which will display a gump that will 
			allow the player to quickly return to the auction).</P>
		<P>Restrictions on bidding:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Characters belonging to the same account as the auction owner cannot place bids 
			on the auction.
			<LI>
				Staff cannot place bids but can create auctions.</LI></UL>
		<P>Players can outbid themselves (for example to meet the reserve).</P>
		<P>7. Item checks and gold checks</P>
		<P>Items and gold are moved through the system using checks. A check, when double 
			clicked, will show the player a gump which will specify the name of the auction 
			(if the auction still exists in the system, a button will allow the player to 
			view the auction page), and the reason of the check. A button will allow the 
			player to claim the gold or item by placing it in their bank.</P>
		<P>8. Ambiguous situations and auction messages</P>
		<P>In two situations, when an auction ends, the system will not be able to take a 
			decision about the outcome:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Reserve hasn't been met. In this case the auction owner will have to decide 
			whether to sell or not.
			<LI>
				One or more items in the auction no longer exist. This can occur in case of 
				item wipes or serialization errors. In this case the buyer will be able to 
				decide whether to purchase or not.</LI></UL>
		<P>When an auction end with an ambiguous situation a message will be dispatched to 
			both the owner and the buyer (provided they're online). The system also handles 
			the Login event, and if the owner or buyer login, they will be presented with a 
			little notice from the system requesting their input.</P>
		<P>This situation can last at most at few days, as specified in the auction 
			configuration.</P>
		<P>9. Administering the system</P>
		<P>The system takes little to none administration. Besides to starting and stopping 
			it, there should be no need to tweak it. The staff can only review bids, but 
			cannot interfere in an auction itself (by either modifying its parameters or 
			deleting it).</P>
