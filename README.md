# Rasengardt C# custom scripts (UO Server)

This is a collection of RunUO scripts and systems that I developed in the past for a custom server named *Rasengardt*. It includes many new systems and specific creations under the UO world, such as:

* A custom jailing system.
* Systems for storing karma and kills, allowing "evil" players to participate in events.
* A custom PvP experience and rewarding system (Kill awards).
* New custom resources (such as specific woods).
* A complete custom item set, race-themed (complete documentation [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20051222081020/http://www.lan-z.net/foro/index.php?s=ae53df4d31b6e755e76d579317279428&showtopic=32387)) - in spanish.
* A system for player-affiliation zones with own guards (e.g. zones for PKs)
* Diverse new NPCs.
* ... and many more.

Rasegardt was a chilean UO custom server (or *shard*) using RunUO, a C#-based emulator. The server was pretty active in 2005-2006's. Some links:
